# Ven-Bowl
Ven-Bowl is a 5 project solution.

Project 1:
  Ven-BowlCMD (Main Startup project) - This is a small comand line application that allows for quick testing of the VenBowl libraries.
  
Project 2:
  VenBowlScoring - This is a bowling scoring library providing access to objects like Game, Player, Scorecard, Frame, BowlingNumbers. This project is consumed by Ven-BowlCMD and XUnitTestVenBowlScoring.
  
Project 3:
  XUnitTestVenBowlScoring - This is a unit test project for the VenBowlScoring library.

Project 4:
  VenBowlMechanics - This library holds unimplemented Mechanical concepts that are not needed for scoring but would be needed for a full blown bowling application.
  
Project 5:
  KGerdeDevOpsKit - This project holds my personal tools to make every day coding easier in visual studio.
